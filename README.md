Checkmate is an open source uptime manager, server & Docker monitoring tool used to track the operational status and performance of servers and websites. It regularly checks whether a server/website is accessible and performs optimally, providing real-time alerts and reports on the monitored services' availability, downtime, and response time. Checkmate also has an agent, called [Capture](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/capture), to retrieve data from remote servers. While Capture is not required to run Checkmate, it provides additional insigths about your servers' CPU, RAM, disk and temperature status.
