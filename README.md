<p align="center"><strong>An open source server monitoring application</strong></p>

(yes, we have a light theme as well, but this looks better on readme.md)

Checkmate is an open source uptime manager, server & Docker monitoring tool used to track the operational status and performance of servers and websites. It regularly checks whether a server/website is accessible and performs optimally, providing real-time alerts and reports on the monitored services' availability, downtime, and response time.

## Features

- Completely open source, deployable on your servers
- Website monitoring
- Port monitoring
- Ping monitoring
- Incidents at a glance
- Page speed monitoring
- E-mail notifications
- Scheduled maintenance

**Roadmap (short term):**

We are actively developing **infrastructure monitoring** features for Checkmate, which will include comprehensive monitoring of memory, disk usage, and CPU performance. Our goal is to build a lightweight agent that runs on Linux servers, continuously collecting and transmitting health metrics to Checkmate, where the data will be visualized for real-time insights.

Additionally, we will introduce **Docker monitoring** to track the performance and health of containerized environments.

**Roadmap (long term):**

- DNS monitoring
- SSL monitoring
- Status pages
